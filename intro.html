        <h1 align="center" id="content">Introduction to Web Developement</h1>
        <p>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It encompasses a range of tasks, including web design, web programming, and database management. The field can be broadly divided into two main areas: front-end development and back-end development.

            <br><h3>Front-End Development</h3>
            This is the part of web development that deals with the visual and interactive aspects of a website. Front-end developers use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create user interfaces that are both functional and appealing. They ensure that a site is responsive, meaning it looks good and works well on various devices, from desktops to smartphones.
            
            <br><h3>Back-End Development</h3>
            Back-end development focuses on the server-side of web applications. It involves building and maintaining the server, databases, and application logic that power the front end. Common back-end programming languages include Python, Ruby, PHP, and Java, often using frameworks like Django or Ruby on Rails. Back-end developers also manage data storage and retrieval, ensuring that everything functions smoothly behind the scenes.
            
            <br><h3>Full-Stack Development</h3>
            Full-stack developers are proficient in both front-end and back-end technologies, allowing them to handle all aspects of a web project. This versatility is highly valued, as it enables them to understand how different components interact.
            
            <br><h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
            Web development utilizes various tools and technologies, including version control systems like Git, content management systems (CMS) like WordPress, and libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js for front-end development.
            
            <br><h3>The Development Process</h3>
            The web development process typically includes:
            
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li><p><span style="font-weight:bold;"> Planning:</span>
                    Defining the project scope and requirements.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Design:</span>
                    Creating wireframes and visual designs.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Development:</span>
                    Writing code and building the website.</p>
                </li>
            </ol> 
            <br><h3>Conclusion</h3>
            Web development is a dynamic and constantly evolving field, driven by technological advancements and changing user needs. Whether you're interested in building simple websites or complex web applications, there are plenty of resources and communities to help you get started.
